# vehicle-challenge-2023
This is kind of my first serious Project as an upcoming Data Analyst in 2023

Programming challenge
The data to be used in this challenge can be found in the vehicle_data.xlsx file. Please note that the data must first be processed, i.e. not yet available in a quality that enables real insight generation.
The source file vehicle_data.xlsx contains data for 500 vehicles:
In the sales code tab you will nd 500 trucks whose unique vehicle identification number (VIN) is shown as a hash in the h_vehicle_hash column. Each vehicle is broken down by production date, country the vehicle was sold to and sales_code_array. The last column contains codes that describe the exact composition of the vehicle*. In the engines tab you will nd 9 sales codes that provide information about which engine is installed in the vehicle in question. You can use the vehicle_hash table to map the hashed VIN back into the original representation.
The challenge is divided into two parts. The first part targets your software development skills. When designing the code, adhere to the most common clean code rules and, if possible, pursue test-driven development. In the second part of the task, you should carry out various analyses. To do this, use the data that you prepared in part one of the task.
Before you start, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the datasets. Get an overview and explore the connections between the data sets.
